After investing time and effort into designing and developing a website that truly represents me, I am thrilled to introduce you to my new portfolio website! I decided to build this site from scratch, steering clear of templates, to create a space that genuinely reflects my style and preferences.

I built the site using the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework, renowned for delivering exceptional performance and optimized build outputs. Simply put, it's designed to load quickly and efficiently.

## Embracing transparency and collaboration
I've made this website's codebase fully open-source. By doing so, I encourage you to review [my code](https://github.com/lukeliasi), learn from it, suggest improvements and even draw inspiration for your own projects. I hope that sharing my work in this way fosters a sense of community and learning among developers. If you find my open-source codebase helpful, I'd appreciate it if you could give [the repository](https://github.com/lukeliasi/lukeliasi.com) a star ‚≠ê on GitHub to show your support and help others discover it too!

## So, what can you expect from this blog?
Most of the content will revolve around my work, experiences, and insights into the world of technology. I'll also be posting various code snippets and tech notes that I find interesting or useful. My aim is to share valuable knowledge and engage with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts. If time permits, I plan to publish new posts on a regular basis.

Don't forget to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lukeliasi), where I'll announce new posts and share interesting tidbits. Additionally, you can sign up for my newsletter to receive updates on my latest work, adventures, and insights directly in your inbox.

Until next time, happy coding!
